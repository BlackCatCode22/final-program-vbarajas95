# JavaFinalProgramSpr23
JavaFinalProgramSpr23 contains the starting files needed for the class final program.

Animals are arriving from zoos around the world and you must organize then into habitats and give them names and bithdates. You must note the age, sex, species, color, and weight of each animal and calculate a birthday from the information you receive from the originating zoo. (use  a function for this called: generateBirthDay) What will you do if the birth season is unknown? Calculate a uniqueID (using a function) and a place in your zoo using an array. Each species must have its own habitat. 

Use fileIO for reading the input file and producing the report. Use lists, arrays, and other data structures as you like. 

You must use structs, classes, lists, or linked lists and demonstrate object-oriented design as youâ€™ve been studying since the midterm. Information will arrive in the following format with an unknown number of lines.

You will use java methods to calculate the following data elements for each animal:
Unique animal ID (must resemble Hy01, Li02, Ti04, etc.),
animal name (from the animalNames text file, 
birth date (YYYY-MM-DD), 
color, 
weight, 
origin

You must place species in their own habitat and output a report similiar to zooPopulation.txt.
